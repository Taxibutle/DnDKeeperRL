I may have done some of this, but not everything was by me. For example, we have the following people who helped me make this mod.

- 37, Made beholder's spells and gave feedback
- Archdiggle, Aboleth and Chuul sprites
- Game Dungeon, at some point probably helped with modding problems and workarounds
